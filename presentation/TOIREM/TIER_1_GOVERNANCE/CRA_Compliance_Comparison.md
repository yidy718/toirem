# Why Research-Backed Thresholds Are More CRA Compliant
## A Comparison for Toirem Canada Partners
### December 30, 2025

---

## Executive Summary

This document compares two approaches to setting financial assistance eligibility thresholds for Orthodox Jewish families:

| Approach | Description | CRA Risk Level |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Approach A** | Ad-hoc thresholds based on "community knowledge" without documentation | 🔴 HIGH RISK |
| **Approach B** | Research-backed thresholds tied to government data sources | 🟢 LOW RISK |

**Recommendation:** Adopt Approach B (research-backed) to ensure CRA compliance and protect the organization's charitable status.

---

## The CRA Requirement

To operate as a registered charity providing "relief of poverty," the CRA requires:

> "A charity relieving poverty must direct its resources to people who lack the necessities of life... The charity should be able to demonstrate how it determines that a person is in need."
> — CRA Guidance CG-029

### What CRA Auditors Look For:

1. ✅ **Objective criteria** for determining eligibility
2. ✅ **Documented methodology** showing how thresholds were set
3. ✅ **Evidence-based justification** for any thresholds above standard poverty lines
4. ✅ **Consistent application** of criteria across all beneficiaries
5. ✅ **Verifiable sources** for cost-of-living data

---

## Approach A: Ad-Hoc Thresholds (HIGH RISK)

### How It Works
- Thresholds set based on "what feels right" or "community consensus"
- No documentation of how numbers were derived
- May use round numbers ($100,000, $150,000) without justification
- Relies on Inspector discretion without clear guidelines

### Example
> "A family of 6 earning $120,000 qualifies because everyone knows Orthodox families need more."

### CRA Problems with This Approach

| Issue | CRA Concern | Risk |
|-------|-------------|------|
| **No methodology** | "How did you arrive at these numbers?" | Audit finding |
| **No sources** | "What evidence supports these thresholds?" | Potential revocation |
| **Subjective criteria** | "Different inspectors could reach different conclusions" | Inconsistent application |
| **High thresholds** | "Why is $120,000 considered poverty?" | Private benefit concerns |
| **No poverty line reference** | "How does this relate to MBM?" | Failure to demonstrate need |

### Worst Case Scenario
CRA could determine that assistance is going to people who are NOT in poverty, which means:
- Organization is providing **private benefit**, not charitable relief
- Charitable status could be **revoked**
- Directors could face **personal liability**
- Donors could lose **tax receipts retroactively**

---

## Approach B: Research-Backed Thresholds (LOW RISK)

### How It Works
- Start with **official government baseline** (Statistics Canada SHS: $65,344)
- Document **each additional cost** with sources
- Show **clear calculation methodology**
- Reference **official poverty measures** (MBM, IRIS) for context
- Maintain **audit trail** of all data sources

### Example
> "A family of 6 with verified income of $120,000 qualifies because:
> - Base cost of living (StatsCan SHS 2023): $88,214
> - + Kosher food premium (+40%): $8,400
> - + Jewish education (4 children × $8,500): $34,000
> - + Religious obligations: $15,966
> - + Housing premium (4BR near synagogue): $12,000
> - **Total documented need: $158,580**
> - Income shortfall: $38,580
> - Assistance: 60% of shortfall = $23,148"

### Why CRA Accepts This Approach

| Element | CRA Benefit | Evidence |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Government baseline** | Anchored to official data | StatsCan Table 11-10-0222-01 |
| **Documented premiums** | Each cost justified separately | CFIA, CMHC, Federation CJA |
| **Poverty line context** | Shows relationship to MBM | $49,244 MBM vs. $158,580 actual need |
| **Clear formula** | Reproducible calculations | 60% of verified shortfall |
| **Verification requirements** | NOA required for $5,000+ | Prevents abuse |

### CRA Precedent
The CRA has accepted that certain communities face higher costs:
- Disability-related expenses above standard
- Remote/Northern community cost premiums
- Cultural/religious requirements creating unavoidable costs

**Key:** You must DOCUMENT these costs with credible sources.

## Side-by-Side Comparison

### Threshold Justification

| Family Size | Approach A (Ad-Hoc) | Approach B (Research) | CRA Defensibility |
|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| Family of 4 | "$100,000 seems right" | $110,496 (documented) | B wins |
| Family of 6 | "$150,000 community standard" | $158,580 (calculated) | B wins |
| Family of 8 | "$200,000 because large family" | $199,974 (sourced) | B wins |

### Documentation Quality

| Element | Approach A | Approach B |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| Baseline source | ❌ None | ✅ StatsCan SHS 2023 |
| Kosher premium evidence | ❌ "Everyone knows" | ✅ CFIA, price comparisons |
| Education costs | ❌ Estimated | ✅ CAPS program, Federation CJA |
| Religious obligations | ❌ Not itemized | ✅ Line-by-line breakdown |
| Housing premium | ❌ Assumed | ✅ CMHC data + community surveys |
| Formula transparency | ❌ Discretionary | ✅ 60% of verified shortfall |
| Income verification | ❌ Self-declaration | ✅ NOA required for $5,000+ |

### Audit Preparedness

| Scenario | Approach A Response | Approach B Response |
|----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| CRA asks: "How did you set thresholds?" | "Community consensus" | "See Master Calculations Document with all sources" |
| CRA asks: "Why is $150K considered poverty?" | "Orthodox families need more" | "See 8 research documents totaling 50+ pages with government citations" |
| CRA asks: "How do you verify need?" | "Inspector signature" | "NOA verification + documented cost analysis" |
| CRA asks: "Show me your methodology" | ❌ None exists | ✅ Complete audit trail |

## The Numbers: Research vs. Official Poverty Lines

### Context Is Everything

| Measure | Family of 4 | Family of 6 | Family of 8 | Source |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| **MBM (Official Poverty Line)** | $49,244 | $60,118 | $69,596 | StatsCan |
| **IRIS Living Income** | $85,200 | ~$104,000 | ~$120,000 | IRIS Quebec |
| **General Population Actual** | $65,584 | $88,400 | $107,800 | StatsCan SHS |
| **Hasidic Family Actual** | $110,496 | $158,580 | $199,974 | Our Research |

### How to Present This to CRA

> "Our thresholds are approximately **2x the official MBM poverty line**. This is justified because:
>
> 1. **Kosher food costs 40-80% more** than regular food (CFIA-regulated certification)
> 2. **Jewish education costs $7,000-$12,000 per child** (public school assumed in MBM)
> 3. **Religious obligations cost $15,966/year** (not captured in any government measure)
> 4. **Large family housing is scarce** and commands premium pricing
>
> Our research documents these costs line-by-line with government sources. We are not arbitrarily inflating poverty thresholds — we are accurately measuring the ACTUAL cost of living for this specific community."

## Responding to Partner Objections

### "This is too complicated"

**Response:** CRA compliance IS complicated. The alternative is losing charitable status. This research protects everyone.

### "We've always done it the other way"

**Response:** Past practice doesn't equal CRA compliance. Many charities have lost status for exactly this reason. We should fix it now, not after an audit.

### "Our thresholds are similar to the research anyway"

**Response:** Great! Then documenting them properly costs us nothing and protects us completely. The numbers aren't the issue — the documentation is.

### "The Inspector knows the community"

**Response:** Inspector knowledge is valuable, but CRA requires DOCUMENTED criteria. An Inspector's judgment should be informed by research, not replace it.

### "This will slow down approvals"

**Response:** The verification requirements only apply to amounts over $5,000. Under $5,000 still only needs a signed declaration. Most families won't be affected.

### "What if our current thresholds are wrong?"

**Response:** Then we adjust them based on evidence. It's better to have defensible thresholds than indefensible ones — even if they're different from what we used before.

---

## Recommendation

### Adopt the Research-Backed Approach Because:

1. **It protects our charitable status** — The #1 priority
2. **It's based on the same community knowledge** — Just documented properly
3. **It creates an audit trail** — CRA can see exactly how we make decisions
4. **It's fair and consistent** — Same formula applies to every family
5. **It's defensible publicly** — If media or donors ask, we have answers
6. **It's professional** — Shows we take our responsibilities seriously

### Implementation Steps

1. ✅ Research documents completed (December 2025)
2. ⬜ Board adopts updated policy with research references
3. ⬜ Master Calculations document finalized
4. ⬜ Inspector training on new verification requirements
5. ⬜ Existing cases reviewed for compliance
6. ⬜ Annual review process established

---

## Conclusion

**The choice is clear:**

| Option | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| Keep doing what we've always done | Risk losing everything |
| Adopt research-backed approach | Protect the organization |

Our thresholds may end up being SIMILAR to what we've used before. But now they'll be **documented, defensible, and CRA-compliant**.

That's not bureaucracy — that's due diligence.

## Appendix: Quick Reference

### Our Key Thresholds (Research-Backed)

| Family Size | Threshold | Based On |
|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Single | $32,134 | StatsCan baseline |
| Couple | $48,286 | StatsCan baseline |
| Family of 4 | $110,496 | Baseline + documented premiums |
| Family of 6 | $158,580 | Baseline + documented premiums |
| Family of 8 | $199,974 | Baseline + documented premiums |
| Family of 10 | $240,666 | Baseline + documented premiums |

### Official Benchmarks (For Context)

| Measure | Family of 4 | What It Represents |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| MBM Poverty Line | $49,244 | Bare minimum survival |
| IRIS Living Income | $85,200 | Minimum for dignity |
| StatsCan SHS | $65,344 | Average Quebec spending |
| Our Threshold | $110,496 | Actual Hasidic family need |

### The Gap Explained

Our threshold is **$61,252 higher** than MBM for a family of 4. Here's where it goes:

| Additional Cost | Amount | % of Gap |
|-----------------|--------|----------|
| Kosher food premium | $6,000 | 10% |
| Jewish education (2 kids) | $17,000 | 28% |
| Religious obligations | $15,966 | 26% |
| Housing premium | $7,200 | 12% |
| Other (baseline adjustment) | $15,086 | 24% |
| **TOTAL** | **$61,252** | **100%** |

Every dollar is documented. Every source is cited. Every calculation is reproducible.

**That's CRA compliance.**
