# DIRECT PAYMENT POLICY
## Toirem Canada — Payment Methods and Documentation
### December 2025

---

## 1. OVERVIEW

Toirem Canada provides financial assistance through various payment methods, including checks and e-transfers issued directly to recipients. This policy establishes documentation requirements that balance CRA compliance with practical community realities.

**Guiding Principle:** Recipients sign a declaration attesting to their need and intended use of funds. This self-declaration model is consistent with food banks and other CRA-registered poverty relief charities.

---

## 2. PAYMENT METHODS

### 2.1 Available Methods

| Method | Description | When Used |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Direct to vendor** | Payment to landlord, utility company, school, etc. | When vendor accepts and recipient prefers |
| **Check to recipient** | Check made payable to recipient | Common method; recipient handles payment |
| **E-transfer to recipient** | Interac e-transfer to recipient | Urgent needs; recipient preference |
| **Gift cards** | Grocery store gift cards | Food assistance |
| **Cash** | Physical cash | Emergency only; requires director approval |

### 2.2 No Preference Required

Unlike policies that mandate vendor payment, Toirem Canada allows staff to use the most practical payment method for each situation. **All methods are acceptable** with proper documentation.

**Rationale:** Many of our beneficiaries:
- Have landlords who prefer to receive rent from tenants directly
- Need flexibility to pay multiple small expenses
- Face language barriers when we contact vendors
- Value dignity of handling their own payments

---

## 4. FOLLOW-UP PROCESS

### 4.1 Purpose of Follow-Up

Follow-up is **not** to verify receipts or audit spending. It's to:
- Check if the assistance resolved the crisis
- Identify if additional help is needed
- Build relationship and trust
- Document outcomes for impact reporting

### 4.2 Follow-Up Schedule

| Amount | Follow-Up Required? | What to Do |
|--------|--------------------| -----------|
| Under $1,000 | No | None required |
| $1,000 - $2,999 | Optional | Brief check-in call if time permits |
| $3,000 - $4,999 | Recommended | 30-day check-in call |
| $5,000+ | Yes | 30-day and 90-day check-in |

### 4.3 What a Follow-Up Call Sounds Like

**Do say:**
> "Hi, this is [Name] from Toirem. We're just checking in to see how things are going. Did the assistance help with your situation? Is there anything else you need?"

**Don't say:**
> "Can you send us your rent receipt?" or "We need proof you paid your bills."

### 4.4 Documenting Follow-Up

Note in recipient file:
```
Follow-up: [Date]
Spoke with: [Recipient name]
Outcome: [e.g., "Rent paid, family stable" or "Still struggling, may need additional help"]
Staff: [Your name]
```

## 6. CRA COMPLIANCE

### 6.1 How This Meets CRA Requirements

| CRA Requirement | How We Meet It |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Beneficiaries in poverty | Declaration + NOA for larger amounts |
| Funds for charitable purpose | Stated purpose + recipient acknowledgment |
| Adequate books and records | Application, payment records, follow-up notes |
| Due diligence | ID verification, database tracking, periodic follow-up |

### 6.2 Why We Don't Require Receipts

1. **CRA doesn't require them** — No CRA guidance mandates receipt collection from beneficiaries
2. **Food bank precedent** — Self-declaration is standard in poverty relief sector
3. **Declaration is sufficient** — Recipient attests under signature to intended use
4. **Practical barriers** — Many recipients cannot easily provide receipts
5. **Trust-based model** — Consistent with community values and effective service delivery

### 6.3 If CRA Asks

**Q: "How do you verify funds were used appropriately?"**

**A:** "Recipients specify the purpose of assistance on their application and sign an acknowledgment that funds will be used for that stated purpose. This self-declaration approach is consistent with food banks and other CRA-registered poverty relief charities. For larger ongoing assistance, we conduct periodic check-ins to assess outcomes. We've found this model effectively balances accountability with the practical and cultural barriers our beneficiaries face."

## 7. WHAT WE DO NOT REQUIRE

To be clear, Toirem Canada does **NOT** require:

| Not Required | Reason |
|--------------|--------|
| ❌ Receipts from recipients | Declaration is sufficient |
| ❌ Proof rent was paid | Not CRA-mandated |
| ❌ Bank statements | Invasive; not necessary |
| ❌ Vendor confirmation | Often impractical |
| ❌ Photos of purchases | Excessive |
