## The Reality Gap

When we talk about poverty in Canada, we typically use the Market Basket Measure (MBM) - Canada's official poverty line. For Montreal in 2025, the MBM threshold is approximately **$47,850 for a family of four**.

**But here's the problem:** The typical Hasidic family has **6-8 children**, not 2. And they face mandatory religious expenses that aren't captured in any government poverty measure.

## Real Numbers for Real Families

### What Does It Actually Cost?

Based on Statistics Canada data and community research, here are the **actual annual costs** for Hasidic families in Montreal:

| Family Size | General Population | Hasidic Family | Additional Cost |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Family of 4** | $65,584 | $110,496 | +$44,912 (68%) |
| **Family of 6** | $88,400 | $157,674 | +$69,274 (78%) |
| **Family of 8** | $107,800 | $198,074 | +$90,274 (84%) |
| **Family of 10** | $124,000 | $238,766 | +$114,766 (93%) |

## Why Are Costs So Much Higher?

### 1. Family Size Reality
- **Quebec average:** 1.6 children per family
- **Hasidic average:** 6-8 children per family
- **Impact:** Every expense multiplies - housing, food, clothing, utilities

### 2. Kosher Food Requirements (Religious Law)
- **Regular chicken:** $8.78/kg
- **Kosher chicken:** $17.60/kg (100% more)
- **Annual impact for family of 8:** Additional $11,200
- *Source: Statistics Canada food prices vs. kosher market prices*

### 3. Religious Education (Mandatory for Community)
- **Public school:** $0
- **Jewish day school:** $7,000-$10,120 per child (after government subsidies)
- **Family with 6 children:** $42,000-$60,720 annually
- *Note: Quebec provides 60% funding, families still pay thousands*

### 4. Religious Obligations (Not Optional)
Annual costs that don't exist for other families:
- **Sabbath preparation (52 weeks):** $6,266
- **Religious holidays:** $8,700
- **Synagogue membership:** $1,000
- **Total:** $15,966 minimum

### 5. Housing Challenges
- Need 5+ bedrooms (gender separation required by religious law)
- Must live walking distance to synagogue (no driving on Sabbath)
- Limited availability: <2% of Montreal rentals have 4+ bedrooms
- **Result:** Premium of $1,000-$1,500/month above market rates

## The Income Reality

### Employment Limitations
- Many mothers cannot work outside the home (managing 6-8 children)
- Religious study obligations limit work hours
- Language barriers (Yiddish primary language for 70%)
- **Median household income:** $42,000 (Federation CJA data)

### The Math Doesn't Work
- **Family of 8 costs:** $198,074
- **Typical income:** $42,000
- **Annual deficit:** $156,074
- **Result:** 45% of Hasidic families live below the poverty line

---

## Why This Matters

### It's Not About "Poor Choices"
These families aren't choosing expensive lifestyles. They're following religious obligations that are as mandatory to them as:
- Feeding their children
- Providing shelter
- Keeping them clothed

### Traditional Support Systems Are Overwhelmed
- Community charity can't keep up with need
- Government programs cap benefits at 3-4 children
- Food banks don't provide kosher food
- Housing subsidies have 5+ year wait lists

## How Toirem Canada Helps

We provide emergency financial assistance based on **actual costs**, not theoretical poverty lines.

### Our Approach
- **Under $5,000:** Quick assistance with simple application
- **Over $5,000:** Income verification and detailed assessment
- **Focus:** Preventing homelessness and ensuring children's basic needs

### Why Different Thresholds?
We recognize that a family with 8 children earning $75,000 may be in deeper poverty than a family of 3 earning $40,000, once you account for:
- Number of dependents
- Mandatory religious expenses
- Lack of government support scaling

---

## The Bottom Line

**Standard poverty measures fail this community because they assume:**
- Families have 2 children, not 8
- Public school is an option
- Regular grocery prices apply
- Religious obligations don't exist
- Housing is available at market rates

**The reality is:**
- These families face 68-93% higher costs than similarly-sized non-Hasidic families
- They have limited ability to increase income
- They cannot reduce many expenses without abandoning their faith
