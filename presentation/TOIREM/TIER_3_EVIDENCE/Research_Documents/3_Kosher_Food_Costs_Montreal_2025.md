## Regulatory Framework (Government of Canada)

### Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) Oversight
According to the CFIA's official guidelines:
- **Regulatory basis**: Safe Food for Canadians Regulations (SFCR), in force since 2019
- **CFIA role**: Ensures regulatory compliance, not religious certification
- **Ritual slaughter**: Explicit flexibility provided for kosher/halal requirements
- **Animal welfare**: CFIA inspectors present at all federally-regulated facilities

### Kosher Certification Process
- **Religious bodies**: Handle actual certification (not government)
- **Labeling requirements**: Must be truthful under Food and Drugs Act
- **CFIA position**: Does not set religious standards or accredit certifiers
- **Consumer protection**: Ensures claims are backed by legitimate certifiers

## Factors Driving Higher Costs

### 1. Certification Structure
- **Multi-layer oversight**: CFIA regulatory + religious certification
- **Mashgiach supervision**: Required on-site supervisors
- **Inspection frequency**: Regular audits and monitoring
- **Limited certifiers**: Fewer authorized bodies increases costs

### 2. Supply Chain Constraints
- **Smaller market**: ~90,000 Jews in Montreal (30% observant)
- **Import requirements**: Many products from US/Israel
- **Special handling**: Separate meat/dairy supply chains
- **Limited economies of scale**: Higher per-unit costs

### 3. Religious Requirements (CFIA Recognized)
- **Ritual slaughter**: Specific methods required
- **Facility separation**: Meat/dairy segregation
- **Passover production**: Complete facility changeover
- **Sabbath restrictions**: Limited operating hours

### 4. Market Dynamics
- **Limited competition**: Few kosher suppliers
- **Geographic concentration**: Clustered in specific neighborhoods
- **Premium positioning**: Often marketed as higher quality
- **Captive market**: No substitutes for observant consumers

## Cost-Saving Strategies Used by Families
