## Montreal, Quebec - 2025

*Prepared for: Faire un Don Canada / Toirem Canada*
*Date: December 30, 2025*
*Purpose: Documentation for CRA Compliance*

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Hasidic Jewish families in Montreal face significantly higher living costs compared to the general population baseline of **$65,344** (Statistics Canada Survey of Household Spending 2023, Table 11-10-0222-01), averaging **40-85% higher expenses** due to religious requirements, larger family sizes, and community-specific needs. This document provides evidence-based research demonstrating these increased costs to justify enhanced assistance thresholds for this population.

**Key Finding:** A typical Hasidic family of 6 requires approximately **$115,000-$145,000** annually for basic living expenses, compared to $88,214 for a non-Hasidic family of the same size (based on Statistics Canada equivalence scales).

## 8. COMMUNITY VULNERABILITY FACTORS

### Additional Challenges

1. **Language Barriers**: Many speak Yiddish as first language, limiting employment options
2. **Limited Secular Education**: Religious studies prioritized, affecting earning potential
3. **Single-Income Households**: Mothers typically home with large families
4. **Community Isolation**: Limited access to government services
5. **No Birth Control**: Family planning not practiced, continuous childcare costs

### Support System Gaps

- Government subsidies don't scale for 6+ children
- Child Tax Benefit caps don't reflect actual costs
- Daycare subsidies unavailable (use religious childcare)
- CAPS education program has income limits

---

## 9. EVIDENCE FROM COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS

### Agency Reports

**Agence Ometz (Montreal Jewish Social Services):**
"We've seen increased demand from lower middle class and even well-to-do families struggling with food costs" - Susan Karpman, Chief Program Officer, 2024

**Federation CJA:**
- 2,800 children receive financial subsidies totaling $3 million
- 56% of Jewish children attend day schools requiring tuition
- Growing need for assistance in Orthodox communities

---

## 10. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### Key Findings

1. **Hasidic families face 35-85% higher living costs** than general population
2. **Primary drivers**: Kosher food (+40%), education (avg $7,000/child), religious obligations ($15,000+/year)
3. **Average family size** is 4-5 times larger than Canadian average
4. **Current poverty thresholds** don't reflect these realities

### Recommendations for Toirem Canada

1. **Apply 40% adjustment** to standard income thresholds for Hasidic families
2. **Recognize family size** impacts (6+ children is common, not exceptional)
3. **Consider religious expenses** as necessary, not discretionary
4. **Account for education costs** as basic need for community integration

## APPENDIX: VERIFICATION METHODS

To verify these costs for individual families:

1. **Food Costs**: Compare grocery receipts from kosher vs. regular stores
2. **Education**: School tuition invoices
3. **Housing**: Lease agreements showing bedroom requirements
4. **Religious**: Synagogue membership, holiday expense receipts
5. **Family Size**: Government documentation (CCB statements, tax returns)

**For CRA Review:** This research demonstrates that religious and cultural requirements create unavoidable additional expenses for Hasidic Jewish families, justifying adjusted poverty thresholds for charitable assistance purposes under the relief of poverty charitable category.
