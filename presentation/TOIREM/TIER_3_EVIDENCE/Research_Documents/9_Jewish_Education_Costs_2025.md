# Jewish Education Costs in Montreal - 2025-2026
**Updated: December 30, 2025**

## Executive Summary

Jewish day school education in Montreal costs between $7,000-$19,400 per child annually. Quebec government subsidies provide approximately 60% of public school per-pupil funding to qualifying private religious schools ($4,700-$6,000 per student), while the Federation CJA's CAPS program offers additional income-based assistance. For Orthodox families with 6-8 children, net education expenses still reach $22,000-$27,000 annually even with maximum subsidies, representing a significant burden on household budgets.
