# Quebec Poverty Line and Market Basket Measure (MBM) - 2025
**Updated: December 30, 2025**

## Executive Summary

Quebec maintains the lowest poverty rate in Canada at 7.4% (2023, up 0.8% from 2022), with Montreal facing unique challenges where approximately 25% of the population lives in or near poverty. The Market Basket Measure (MBM), Canada's Official Poverty Line since 2019, underwent its third comprehensive review with new 2023-base methodology finalized November 7, 2025.

**Montreal-Specific Key Figures (2024-2025):**
- **Family of 4 MBM Threshold (2024)**: $49,244/year ($4,104/month) - *StatsCan Table 11-10-0066-01*
- **Single Person MBM Threshold (2024)**: $24,622/year ($2,052/month) - *calculated using square root equivalence*
- **IRIS Living Income Single Person (2025)**: $40,084/year (minimum for dignity)
- **IRIS Living Income Family of 4 (2024)**: $78,882/year
- **Cost of living increase since 2020**: 21.8% (housing +31.4%, food +28.2%)
- **Single persons poverty rate**: 16% (3x higher than those not living alone)

## Market Basket Measure (MBM) - Canada's Official Poverty Line

### Definition
The Poverty Reduction Act (2019) established the Market Basket Measure as Canada's Official Poverty Line. The MBM establishes poverty thresholds based on the cost of a specific basket of goods and services representing a modest, basic standard of living.

### MBM Components
The basket includes:
- **Food**: Nutritious diet based on Canada's Food Guide
- **Clothing and Footwear**: Essential items for all family members
- **Shelter**: Rental costs for appropriate housing
- **Transportation**: Public transit or modest vehicle costs
- **Other Items**: Personal care, household supplies, furniture, modest recreation
- **NEW 2025**: Communications services (landline, cell phone, internet)

### Quebec Government 2025 Indexation
Effective **January 1, 2025**, Quebec implemented a **2.85% indexation** of:
- Personal income tax system
- Social assistance benefits
- Various deductions and tax credits

This adjustment aims to help residents cope with inflationary pressures and maintain purchasing power.

### Adjustments by Family Size
The MBM uses square root equivalence scale:
- Single person: Divide by 2
- Couple: Divide by 1.41
- Family of 3: Divide by 1.73
- Family of 4: Base threshold
- Family of 5: Multiply by 1.12
- Family of 6: Multiply by 1.22

### Geographic Variations within Montreal CMA
The MBM recognizes different costs across Montreal regions. Note: These figures represent sub-regional breakdowns from research papers and may differ from the official StatsCan MBM threshold of $49,244 for the Montreal CMA:
- **Montreal Urban Core**: $40,889 annual threshold (2024 research estimate)
- **Montreal Suburban Areas**: $40,183 annual threshold (2024 research estimate)
- **Transportation costs**: Higher in suburban areas
- **Housing costs**: Higher in urban core

### Quebec Context
- **Provincial poverty rate**: 7.4% (lowest in Canada, 2023)
- **Deep poverty threshold**: 75% of MBM (those in severe poverty)
- **Working poor**: Significant portion despite employment
- **Single persons living alone**: 16% poverty rate (vs 4.8% for those not living alone)

### Quebec Social Assistance Rates (2025)
| Program | Monthly Amount | Annual | Gap to MBM (2024) |
|---------|---------------|--------|-------------------|
| Basic Income Program (B.I.P) | $1,548 | $18,576 | -$6,046 below MBM |
| Social Solidarity Program (S.S.P) | $1,205 | $14,460 | -$10,162 below MBM |

*Note: Both programs provide income below the Montreal MBM threshold of $2,052/month (2024), indicating a structural poverty gap of 25-41% for social assistance recipients.*

## 2023-Base MBM Updates (Finalized November 2025)

### Major Changes Implemented
1. **Communications Services Component**: NEW addition for landline, cell phone, and internet services
2. **Updated Shelter Costs**: Based on current rental market data
3. **Food Basket Revision**: Updated data on food and clothing items
4. **Household Expenditures**: More disaggregated data for accuracy
5. **Transportation Adjustments**: Reflecting modern mobility needs

### Review Process
- **June 2023**: Third comprehensive review launched by Statistics Canada
- **May 2025**: Proposed methodology released for public review
- **November 7, 2025**: 2023-base methodology finalized
- **Fall 2025**: Official implementation of new base

### Quebec-Specific Considerations (CEPE)
The Centre d'étude sur la pauvreté et l'exclusion (CEPE) notes that an additional 7% should be added to MBM thresholds to account for invisible expenses not captured in the standard basket.

## Comparison with Other Poverty Measures

### Market Basket Measure (MBM) - Official
- **Status**: Canada's Official Poverty Line since 2019
- **Basis**: Cost of basket of goods and services
- **2023-base**: Includes communications services (NEW)

## Recommendations

### For Toirem Canada Operations
1. Use MBM as baseline but adjust for community-specific costs
2. Document all additional expenses beyond MBM basket
3. Maintain alignment with CRA poverty relief guidelines
4. Track both MBM and actual community poverty rates

### For Advocacy
1. Highlight gap between MBM and actual costs for Orthodox families
2. Advocate for religious/cultural adjustments to poverty measures
3. Partner with other organizations serving similar communities
4. Contribute data to future MBM reviews
