# Montreal Cost of Living Analysis - 2025
**Updated: December 30, 2025**

## Executive Summary

Quebec households reported the second-lowest average spending in Canada at $65,344 in 2023 (Statistics Canada Survey of Household Spending, released May 21, 2025). Montreal's cost of living remains below the national average, but large families face disproportionate housing and food costs that are not captured in average household statistics.

## Methodology

Our cost analysis is based on official government data:
- **Statistics Canada** Survey of Household Spending 2023 (latest available)
- **Statistics Canada** Consumer Price Index (November 2025)
- **CMHC** Housing Market Information Portal
- **Quebec Statistics Institute** Population and household data
