# Hasidic Family Cost Differential Analysis - 2025
**Updated: December 30, 2025**

## Executive Summary

Orthodox Jewish families in Montreal face additional costs of 40-85% above the general population baseline of $65,344 (Statistics Canada SHS 2023). These premiums stem from religious requirements not captured in government statistics: kosher food certification requirements (CFIA regulated), private religious education (partially offset by Quebec subsidies), religious obligations, and larger family sizes averaging 6.8 children.

## Additional Costs for Orthodox Jewish Families

Our analysis identifies four major cost drivers creating significant premiums over Statistics Canada baseline costs (Statistics Canada Survey of Household Spending 2023, Table 11-10-0222-01):
