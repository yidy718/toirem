# CRA Compliance for Poverty Relief Charities
## A Flexible, Risk-Based Framework
### Research Compiled: December 30, 2025

---

## Executive Summary

The Canada Revenue Agency takes a **risk-proportionate approach** to poverty relief documentation rather than mandating specific verification procedures. CRA's core guidance document CG-029, revised in October 2024, explicitly allows charities to use simplified self-declaration processes for low-value assistance while requiring more rigorous verification for higher-value or recurring benefits.

**Key Finding for Toirem Canada:** Your two-tier system with $5,000 threshold aligns directly with CRA Guidance CG-032's explicit dollar thresholds.

## 1. CG-029: The Core Guidance Document

**Document:** Relief of poverty and charitable registration (CG-029)
**URL:** https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/charities-giving/charities/policies-guidance/charitable-registration-relief-poverty.html
**Last Updated:** October 23, 2024

### Key Principles from CG-029

CRA establishes that documentation requirements should match the **risk level** of the assistance provided. Four factors determine required rigor:

1. The **value** of the charitable benefit
2. The **frequency** at which it is provided
3. The **location** where it is provided
4. The charity's **operational circumstances**

### When Formal Verification is NOT Required

CG-029 provides this explicit example:

> "A charity provides assistance to individuals with accessing and applying for tax credits, benefits, and deductions that are targeted to low-income families and individuals. The charity decides to not apply selection criteria and processes. It has determined that persons not in need of the benefits are unlikely to access them. **The potential of providing non-incidental private benefit is negligible.**"

### When More Rigorous Verification IS Required

> "When a charity pays utility bills (more than modest value, especially over longer periods), the selection criteria and processes could include mechanisms to ensure that potential beneficiaries continue to experience poverty."

## 2. CG-032: Tiered Documentation Thresholds

**Document:** Registered charities making grants to non-qualified donees (CG-032)
**URL:** https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/charities-giving/charities/policies-guidance/charities-making-grants-non-qualified-donees.html
**Date:** December 2023

### Explicit Dollar Thresholds

| Grant Amount | Risk Level | Documentation Required |
|--------------|------------|------------------------|
| Up to **$5,000** | Low | Simple agreement; email/meeting minutes may suffice |
| $5,000–$50,000 | Medium | Formal written agreement with key terms |
| Over $50,000 | High | Comprehensive formal agreement, detailed reporting |

### CRA Statement on Low-Risk Amounts

> "A written agreement may not be necessary for non-recurring grants of $5,000 or less. Other documentation may be enough to satisfy the requirements in very low-risk circumstances. This documentation could include written communications, such as email records and meeting minutes."

**Significance for Toirem Canada:** Your $5,000 threshold for simplified processing directly matches CRA's explicit guidance.

## 3. Self-Declarations Are CRA-Compliant

### Food Bank Precedent

Major Canadian food banks operate as CRA-registered charities using simplified intake:

**Daily Bread Food Bank (Toronto)**
- URL: https://www.dailybread.ca/need-food/how-it-works/
- Requirements: Name, address, date of birth for household members
- No formal income verification required
- Fully CRA-compliant for decades

**United Way Food Banks**
- URL: https://www.unitedwaygt.org/issues/how-food-banks-in-canada-work-and-why-theyre-necessary/
- Basic intake forms only
- Staff philosophy: "I'm not going to send anybody away without food"
- CRA-compliant because benefits are modest and population unlikely to include those not in need

### Why Self-Declaration Works

CG-029 does **not prohibit** self-declarations and does **not mandate** income verification. The requirement is that whatever method is used must:
1. Be documented
2. Enable CRA to verify beneficiaries are experiencing poverty
3. Match the risk level of the benefit

---

## 4. Flexibility on Poverty Thresholds

### No Mandated Poverty Line

CG-029 Paragraph 4 states:
> "The courts have not set a uniform measure of poverty. Rather, a person may or may not experience poverty depending on environment and individual circumstances."

### Acceptable Government Measures

- Low-Income Cut-Offs (LICO)
- Low Income Measures (LIM)
- Market Basket Measures (MBM)
- Provincial housing income thresholds

### Custom Charity Criteria Permitted

CG-029 allows charities to develop their own criteria considering:
- Employment status
- Total household income
- Number of dependents
- Assets
- Medical expenses
- Childcare expenses
- Commuting costs

### Geographic Variations Accepted

CRA's October 2024 guidance includes income thresholds that vary by community:
- Vancouver: $86,000 for family
- Whitecourt, AB: $52,000 for same household size

**This demonstrates CRA acceptance of community-specific calculations.**

---

## 5. Religious Community Thresholds

### Legal Framework Supports Higher Thresholds

While no specific case law addresses kosher food or religious education as poverty factors, CG-029's framework supports this approach:

CG-029 identifies factors including:
- "The cost of basic necessities of life and simple amenities"
- "Geographic location"
- Lists food as a basic necessity

### Defensible Arguments for Orthodox Jewish Families

1. **Kosher food** (40-80% higher cost) is a religious requirement, not preference
2. **Religious education** may be considered equivalent to "learning materials and school supplies" (listed in CG-029 as a simple amenity)
3. These costs should factor into determining whether a family has means to acquire basic necessities

### Key Requirement: Document the Methodology

Create a written policy explaining:
- How thresholds are calculated
- Community-specific cost adjustments
- Factors considered (kosher food premium, education costs, religious obligations)
- Government sources used (Statistics Canada, CMHC, etc.)

## 6. Record Retention Requirements

### CRA Retention Periods

| Document Type | Retention Period |
|---------------|------------------|
| General ledgers, financial statements, T3010 returns | **6 years** from end of tax year |
| Source documents (invoices, vouchers, contracts) | **6 years** from end of tax year |
| Official donation receipts | Minimum **2 years** from calendar year |
| Governing documents, bylaws, meeting minutes | Duration of registration **plus 2 years** |

**Source:** https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/charities-giving/charities/checklists-charities/keeping-adequate-books-records.html

### Storage Requirements

- Must be kept at a **Canadian address** on file with CRA
- Must be in **English or French**
- Electronic records acceptable if kept in "electronically readable format"

### For Poverty Relief Specifically

Charities must document:
1. Selection criteria used to identify beneficiaries experiencing poverty
2. How charitable benefits are provided to those beneficiaries

## 7. Recent CRA Enforcement Trends

### Audit Statistics (2024-2025)

**Source:** https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/charities-giving/charities/about-charities-directorate/report-on-charities-program/report-on-charities-program-2024-2025.html

- **220 audits** completed
- **98%** found some non-compliance
- **40%** revealed serious non-compliance

### Most Common Audit Findings

| Finding | Frequency |
|---------|-----------|
| Incomplete or incorrect T3010 return | **64%** |
| Incomplete or inaccurate donation receipts | **56%** |
| Inadequate books and records | **48%** |

**Note:** Research did not identify cases where charities were revoked solely for inadequate poverty verification documentation. The focus is on administrative compliance.

### High-Risk Enforcement Priorities (2024-2025)

- Aggressive tax planning
- Offshore activities
- Ineligible individuals

**Not** poverty verification methodology.

---

## 8. Key Legal Case

### Credit Counselling Services of Atlantic Canada Inc. v. Canada (2016 FCA 193)

**Holding:** "Prevention of poverty is not a charitable purpose"

**Significance:** Beneficiaries must be experiencing poverty **at the time** of receiving assistance. This distinction (relief versus prevention) represents the primary legal risk, not verification methodology.

**Implication for Toirem Canada:** Ensure language describes "relieving" poverty, not "preventing" poverty.

3. Application/intake forms with consent for information collection
4. Verification records showing how eligibility was determined
5. Benefit delivery records (what, to whom, when, value)
6. Periodic re-assessment mechanisms for ongoing benefits

### Methodology Recommendations

- Use government-defined indicators OR create own criteria with documented rationale
- Prioritize fairness, transparency, and consistency
- Avoid overly complex requirements that create barriers
- Conduct regular reviews with stakeholder input
- **Match verification rigor to benefit value**

### Risk Management

- Never describe purposes as "preventing" poverty—use "relieving" poverty
- Ensure beneficiaries are currently experiencing poverty when benefits provided
- Review CG-029 (October 2024 version) for compliance
- **Address top audit issues** (T3010 accuracy, donation receipts, books/records)
