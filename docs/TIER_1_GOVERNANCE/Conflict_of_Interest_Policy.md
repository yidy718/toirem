## 1. PURPOSE

This Conflict of Interest Policy is designed to help directors, officers, employees, and volunteers of Toirem Canada identify situations that present potential conflicts of interest and to provide procedures to appropriately manage conflicts in accordance with legal requirements and the goals of accountability and transparency in operations.

## 2. DEFINITIONS

### 2.1 Conflict of Interest
A conflict of interest arises when a person in a position of authority over the organization may benefit financially from a decision they could make in that capacity, including indirect benefits such as to family members or businesses with which the person is closely associated.

### 2.2 Interested Person
Any director, officer, member of a committee with board-delegated powers, employee, or volunteer who has a direct or indirect financial interest.

### 2.3 Financial Interest
A person has a financial interest if the person has, directly or indirectly:
- An ownership or investment interest in any entity with which the Organization has a transaction or arrangement
- A compensation arrangement with the Organization or with any entity or individual with which the Organization has a transaction or arrangement
- A potential ownership or investment interest in, or compensation arrangement with, any entity or individual with which the Organization is negotiating a transaction or arrangement

## 3. PROCEDURES

### 3.1 Duty to Disclose
In connection with any actual or possible conflict of interest, an interested person must disclose the existence of the financial interest and be given the opportunity to disclose all material facts to the directors considering the proposed transaction or arrangement.

### 3.2 Determining Whether a Conflict of Interest Exists
After disclosure of the financial interest and all material facts, the interested person shall leave the board or committee meeting while the determination of a conflict of interest is discussed and voted upon. The remaining board or committee members shall decide if a conflict of interest exists.

### 3.3 Procedures for Addressing the Conflict of Interest
1. The chairperson of the board or committee shall, if appropriate, appoint a disinterested person or committee to investigate alternatives to the proposed transaction or arrangement.

2. After exercising due diligence, the board or committee shall determine whether the Organization can obtain with reasonable efforts a more advantageous transaction or arrangement from a person or entity that would not give rise to a conflict of interest.

3. If a more advantageous transaction or arrangement is not reasonably possible, the board or committee shall determine by a majority vote of the disinterested directors whether the transaction is:
   - In the Organization's best interest
   - For its own benefit
   - Fair and reasonable

### 3.4 Violations of the Conflict of Interest Policy
If the board or committee has reasonable cause to believe a member has failed to disclose actual or possible conflicts of interest, it shall:
1. Inform the member of the basis for such belief
2. Afford the member an opportunity to explain the alleged failure to disclose
3. Take appropriate disciplinary and corrective action if necessary

## 4. RECORDS OF PROCEEDINGS

The minutes of the board and all committees with board-delegated powers shall contain:

1. The names of the persons who disclosed or otherwise were found to have a financial interest
2. The nature of the financial interest
3. Any action taken to determine whether a conflict of interest was present
4. The board's or committee's decision as to whether a conflict of interest existed
5. The names of the persons who were present for discussions and votes relating to the transaction
6. The content of the discussion
7. A record of any votes taken

## 5. COMPENSATION

### 5.1 Voting Members
A voting member of the board who receives compensation, directly or indirectly, from the Organization for services is precluded from voting on matters pertaining to that member's compensation.

### 5.2 Non-Voting Participation
A voting member of any committee whose jurisdiction includes compensation matters and who receives compensation from the Organization is precluded from voting on matters pertaining to that member's compensation.

## 6. ANNUAL STATEMENTS

Each director, officer, and member of a committee with board-delegated powers shall annually sign a statement which:

1. Affirms that such person:
   - Has received a copy of the conflict of interest policy
   - Has read and understands the policy
   - Has agreed to comply with the policy
   - Understands that the Organization is charitable and must engage primarily in activities which accomplish its tax-exempt purposes

2. Identifies any relationships, positions, or circumstances in which the person is involved that could contribute to a conflict of interest

## 7. PERIODIC REVIEWS

To ensure the Organization operates in a manner consistent with charitable purposes and does not engage in activities that could jeopardize its tax-exempt status, periodic reviews shall be conducted. The reviews shall include:

1. Whether compensation arrangements and benefits are reasonable, based on competent survey information
2. Whether partnerships, joint ventures, and arrangements with management organizations conform to written policies and are properly recorded

## 8. USE OF OUTSIDE ADVISORS

When conducting the periodic reviews, the Organization may, but need not, use outside advisors. If outside advisors are used, their use shall not relieve the board of its responsibility for ensuring periodic reviews are conducted.

- Does or seeks to do business with the Organization
- Is a recipient of services from the Organization
- Has interests that may be substantially affected by the person's performance of duties

### 9.2 Exception
This does not preclude acceptance of items of nominal value (under $50) that are clearly tokens of respect or friendship and not related to any particular transaction.

## 10. CONFIDENTIALITY

Each director, officer, employee, and volunteer shall exercise care not to disclose confidential information acquired in connection with their status or information the disclosure of which might be adverse to the interests of the Organization.
