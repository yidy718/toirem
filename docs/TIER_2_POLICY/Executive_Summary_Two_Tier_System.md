**Charity Name:** Faire un Don Canada / Toirem Canada
**Registration #:** 751018425RR0001
**Effective Date:** January 1, 2025

## SYSTEM OVERVIEW

Toirem Canada operates a two-tier assistance system designed specifically for the Jewish Hasidic community's unique needs:

### Tier 1: Simplified Process (Under $5,000)
- **Documentation:** ID + Application + **Signed Declaration**
- **The Declaration:** Applicant signs "I need financial assistance for my day-to-day needs"
- **This signature replaces all income verification**
- **Processing:** 24-48 hours
- **Rationale:** Reduces barriers for emergency needs

### Tier 2: Full Assessment ($5,000 and Over)
- **Documentation:** Complete income verification (Notice of Assessment from both spouses)
- **Formula:** Provides 60% of deficit (Costs minus Income)
- **Processing:** 5-10 business days
- **Rationale:** Ensures accountability for larger amounts

---

## THE 60% DEFICIT FORMULA (For Amounts Over $5,000)

### How It Works:

1. **Calculate Annual Costs** based on family size using Hasidic family expense table
2. **Verify Income** through Notice of Assessment from both household members
3. **Determine Deficit** (Costs - Income = Deficit)
4. **Provide 60% of Deficit** as maximum assistance

### Example Calculation:

**Family of 8:**
- Annual costs: $168,000 (from research)
- Verified income: $100,000 (from NOAs)
- Deficit: $68,000
- Maximum assistance: $68,000 × 60% = **$40,800**
