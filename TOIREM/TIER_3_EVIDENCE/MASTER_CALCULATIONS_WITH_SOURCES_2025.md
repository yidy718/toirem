# MBM AND IRIS CONTEXT

## Why Traditional Poverty Measures Don't Apply

### Market Basket Measure (MBM) - Canada's Official Poverty Line
- **Montreal 2025 MBM:** $47,850 for family of 4
- **Problems for Hasidic families:**
  - Assumes public school (not religious education)
  - Based on average 1.6 children (not 6-8)
  - Uses general food costs (not kosher)
  - No religious obligations included
  - Housing based on median unit (not 5+ bedrooms)

### IRIS Living Wage Calculations
- **Montreal Living Wage 2025:** $25.13/hour
- **Annual for 2 earners:** $104,540
- **Why inadequate for Hasidic families:**
  - Assumes dual income (many have single earner)
  - Based on 2.2 person household
  - No kosher or religious costs
  - Doesn't scale for large families

### Our Adjusted Methodology
We use actual costs specific to Orthodox Jewish families:
- Real kosher food prices (40-80% premium)
- Actual Jewish day school tuition
- Required religious expenses
- Large family housing costs
- Single-income household reality

# 60% FORMULA RATIONALE

## Why 60% of Deficit?

### Balancing Principles
1. **Self-sufficiency incentive:** Families retain responsibility for 40%
2. **Charitable resources:** Maximizes help while ensuring sustainability
3. **CRA compliance:** Demonstrates shared responsibility
4. **Community standard:** Aligns with other Jewish charities

### Calculation Basis
- **100% coverage:** Creates dependency, removes incentive
- **50% coverage:** Insufficient for genuine need
- **60% coverage:** Optimal balance of support and self-reliance
- **40% family contribution:** Through income, family help, other sources

### Evidence of Effectiveness
- Used successfully by similar organizations
- Prevents welfare dependency
- Encourages workforce participation
- Sustainable for charity operations

# 6. UNIVERSAL FORMULA FOR ANY FAMILY SIZE

## Calculate Assistance Threshold for Any Configuration

### Formula Components

#### Base Costs (Per Person/Unit)
| Component | Formula | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| **Adults** | $24,143 per adult | Base living costs |
| **Children** | $8,500 + (age factor) | Scales with age |
| **Housing Base** | $24,000 (1-2 people) | Minimum for couple |
| **Housing Per Child** | +$6,000 per child | Additional space needed |
| **Religious Obligations** | $15,966 per family | Fixed per household |

### MASTER FORMULA

```
ANNUAL THRESHOLD =
    (Adults × $24,143) +
    (Children × Child_Cost) +
    Housing_Cost +
    Religious_Obligations +
    Special_Adjustments

Where:
- Child_Cost = $8,500 + ($500 × number_of_school_age)
- Housing_Cost = Base + (Children × $6,000)
- Religious_Obligations = $15,966
- Special_Adjustments = Medical needs, disabilities, etc.
```

### Simplified Calculator

#### Step 1: Count Your Family
- Number of adults: ___
- Number of children under 5: ___
- Number of children 5-12: ___
- Number of children 13-17: ___

#### Step 2: Calculate Base Costs

| Component | Calculation | Your Amount |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Adults** | ___ adults × $24,143 | $_______ |
| **Young Children (<5)** | ___ × $8,500 | $_______ |
| **School Age (5-12)** | ___ × $9,000 | $_______ |
| **Teens (13-17)** | ___ × $10,000 | $_______ |
| **Housing** | See table below | $_______ |
| **Religious** | Fixed $15,966 | $15,966 |
| **TOTAL** | Sum all above | $_______ |

#### Housing Cost Table
| Family Size | Annual Housing Cost |
|-------------|-------------------|
| 1-2 people | $24,000 |
| 3 people | $31,200 |
| 4 people | $31,200 |
| 5 people | $36,600 |
| 6 people | $42,000 |
| 7 people | $48,000 |
| 8 people | $54,000 |
| 9+ people | $60,000 |

### Quick Examples Using Formula

#### Example 1: Family of 5 (2 adults, 3 children ages 3, 7, 10)
```
Adults: 2 × $24,143 = $48,286
Children: 1 × $8,500 + 2 × $9,000 = $26,500
Housing: $36,600
Religious: $15,966
TOTAL: $127,352
```

#### Example 2: Single Parent with 2 Teens
```
Adults: 1 × $24,143 = $24,143
Teens: 2 × $10,000 = $20,000
Housing: $31,200
Religious: $15,966
TOTAL: $91,309
```

#### Example 3: Large Family of 11 (2 adults, 9 children mixed ages)
```
Adults: 2 × $24,143 = $48,286
Children (estimate): 9 × $9,000 = $81,000
Housing: $60,000
Religious: $15,966

### Kosher Food Premium Addition
Add 54% to the food portion of costs:
- Single adult food: $4,200 × 1.54 = $6,468
- Per child food: $2,400 × 1.54 = $3,696

### Private Education Premium Addition
Per child in private Jewish school:
- Elementary (K-6): +$8,000/year
- High School (7-11): +$12,000/year

### Maximum Assistance Formula (60% Rule)
```
Maximum Annual Assistance = (Threshold - Actual_Income) × 0.60

Example: Family threshold $127,352, income $60,000
Maximum = ($127,352 - $60,000) × 0.60 = $40,411
```
