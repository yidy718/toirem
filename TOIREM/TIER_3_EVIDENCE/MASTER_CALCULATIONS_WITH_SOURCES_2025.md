|--------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Kosher food premium | 40-80% | 127% | Similar magnitude |
| Education per child | $8,500 | £4,420 ($7,500) | Comparable |

# MBM AND IRIS CONTEXT

## Why Traditional Poverty Measures Don't Apply

### Market Basket Measure (MBM) - Canada's Official Poverty Line
- **Montreal 2025 MBM:** $47,850 for family of 4
- **Problems for Hasidic families:**
  - Assumes public school (not religious education)
  - Based on average 1.6 children (not 6-8)
  - Uses general food costs (not kosher)
  - No religious obligations included
  - Housing based on median unit (not 5+ bedrooms)

### IRIS Living Wage Calculations
- **Montreal Living Wage 2025:** $25.13/hour
- **Annual for 2 earners:** $104,540
- **Why inadequate for Hasidic families:**
  - Assumes dual income (many have single earner)
  - Based on 2.2 person household
  - No kosher or religious costs
  - Doesn't scale for large families

### Our Adjusted Methodology
We use actual costs specific to Orthodox Jewish families:
- Real kosher food prices (40-80% premium)
- Actual Jewish day school tuition
- Required religious expenses
- Large family housing costs
- Single-income household reality

# 60% FORMULA RATIONALE

## Why 60% of Deficit?

### Balancing Principles
1. **Self-sufficiency incentive:** Families retain responsibility for 40%
2. **Charitable resources:** Maximizes help while ensuring sustainability
3. **CRA compliance:** Demonstrates shared responsibility
4. **Community standard:** Aligns with other Jewish charities

### Calculation Basis
- **100% coverage:** Creates dependency, removes incentive
- **50% coverage:** Insufficient for genuine need
- **60% coverage:** Optimal balance of support and self-reliance
- **40% family contribution:** Through income, family help, other sources

### Evidence of Effectiveness
- Used successfully by similar organizations
- Prevents welfare dependency
- Encourages workforce participation
- Sustainable for charity operations

# ANNUAL ASSISTANCE CAPS

## Maximum Annual Assistance by Family Size

| Family Size | Annual Cap | Monthly Max | Rationale |

| 7-8 people | $42,000 | $3,500 | Very large |
| 9-10 people | $48,000 | $4,000 | Exceptional |

---

# QUICK REFERENCE FORMULAS

## For Under $5,000:
**Required:** Signed declaration only
**Formula:** Not applicable - declaration is sufficient

## For $5,000 and Over:
**Required:** Notice of Assessment both spouses
**Formula:** (Annual Costs - Income) × 0.60 = Maximum

## Emergency Override:
**When:** Eviction <7 days, utility cutoff <48 hrs, no food + kids <5
**Process:** Fast-track 24 hours regardless of amount
