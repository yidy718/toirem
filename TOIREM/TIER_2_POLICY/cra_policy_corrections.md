## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Toirem Canada has implemented a two-tier documentation process that balances CRA compliance requirements with the urgent needs and unique challenges of the Hasidic Jewish community we serve. This document explains why we do not require income verification for assistance under $5,000, while maintaining full compliance with our charitable purposes of poverty relief.

**Legal Authority:** This framework is designed in accordance with:
- **CRA Guidance CG-029** "Relief of poverty and charitable registration" (October 2024 revision)
- **CRA Guidance CG-032** "Registered charities making grants to non-qualified donees" (December 2023)

CG-032 explicitly establishes that grants up to $5,000 are "low risk" and may use simplified documentation including "written communications, such as email records and meeting minutes" rather than formal agreements.
```

## Correction 1.2: Add CG-032 Citation to Two-Tier System Table
**Priority:** 🔴 Critical

**Find:**
```
## 1. OUR ASSISTANCE STRUCTURE

### Two-Tier System

| Assistance Level | Documentation Required | Rationale |
|-----------------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Under $5,000** | • Government ID<br>• Completed application<br>• **SIGNED DECLARATION: "I need financial assistance"** | Applicant's signature replaces income verification |
| **$5,000 and Over** | • All above PLUS<br>• Social Insurance Number<br>• Date of birth<br>• Notice of Assessment (both spouses)<br>• Detailed budget | Higher scrutiny for larger amounts |
```

**Replace with:**
```
## 1. OUR ASSISTANCE STRUCTURE

### Two-Tier System

| Assistance Level | Documentation Required | Rationale |
|-----------------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Under $5,000** | • Government ID<br>• Completed application<br>• **SIGNED DECLARATION: "I need financial assistance"** | Low-risk per CG-032; applicant's signature replaces income verification |
| **$5,000 and Over** | • All above PLUS<br>• Social Insurance Number<br>• Date of birth<br>• Notice of Assessment (both spouses)<br>• Detailed budget | Medium/high-risk per CG-032; enhanced scrutiny required |

**CRA Authority:** CG-032 (December 2023) explicitly states: "A written agreement may not be necessary for non-recurring grants of $5,000 or less. Other documentation may be enough to satisfy the requirements in very low-risk circumstances."
```

---

## Correction 1.3: Add CG-029 Risk-Based Framework Citation
**Priority:** 🔴 Critical

**Find:**
```
## 2. JUSTIFICATION FOR SIMPLIFIED PROCESS (Under $5,000)

### THE CORNERSTONE: Signed Declaration of Need

For amounts under $5,000, we accept the applicant's signed declaration stating "I need financial assistance for my personal day-to-day needs" as sufficient verification of poverty.
```

**Replace with:**
```
## 2. JUSTIFICATION FOR SIMPLIFIED PROCESS (Under $5,000)

### CRA's Risk-Based Framework

CRA Guidance CG-029 (October 2024) establishes that documentation requirements should be proportionate to risk. CG-029 states that a charity "may need to apply selection criteria and processes" based on four factors:
1. The **value** of the charitable benefit
2. The **frequency** at which it is provided
3. The **location** where it is provided
4. The charity's **operational circumstances**

For low-value, low-frequency benefits to populations unlikely to include those not in need, CG-029 explicitly states: "The potential of providing non-incidental private benefit is negligible."

### THE CORNERSTONE: Signed Declaration of Need

For amounts under $5,000, we accept the applicant's signed declaration stating "I need financial assistance for my personal day-to-day needs" as sufficient verification of poverty.

## Correction 1.4: Strengthen Food Bank Comparison with CRA Context
**Priority:** 🟡 Medium

**Find:**
```
#### Food Banks Model
- Most food banks don't require tax returns
- Self-declaration of need is standard
- Focus on immediate relief
- **CRA Accepted**: This model has operated for decades
```

**Replace with:**
```
#### Food Banks Model (CRA-Compliant Precedent)
- Daily Bread Food Bank (Toronto): Requires only name, address, date of birth—no income verification
- United Way food banks: Basic intake forms, self-declaration of need
- Self-declaration is standard across the sector
- Focus on immediate relief to populations unlikely to include those not in need
- **CRA Accepted**: These registered charities have operated for decades under this model
- **Legal Basis**: CG-029 permits simplified verification when "the potential of providing non-incidental private benefit is negligible"
```

---

## Correction 1.5: Add "Currently Experiencing Poverty" Language
**Priority:** 🟡 Medium
**Reason:** Key legal distinction from Credit Counselling Services case

**Find:**
```
### How Our Process Meets CRA Requirements:

#### A. Relief of Poverty Test ✓
- All recipients demonstrate financial need
- Assistance addresses basic necessities
- Amounts limited to poverty relief purposes
- No luxury or non-essential items funded
```

**Replace with:**
