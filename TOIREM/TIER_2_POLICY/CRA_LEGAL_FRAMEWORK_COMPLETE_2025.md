# PART IV: OPERATIONAL FRAMEWORK

## 4.1 Two-Tier System Rationale

### Tier 1: Declaration-Based (Under $5,000)

**CRA Legal Authority:**
- **CG-032 (December 2023)** explicitly classifies grants up to $5,000 as "low risk"
- CG-032 states: "A written agreement may not be necessary for non-recurring grants of $5,000 or less"
- **CG-029 (October 2024)** permits simplified verification when "the potential of providing non-incidental private benefit is negligible"
- Similar to food bank model (CRA-compliant for decades)
- Statutory declaration equivalent accepted in Canadian social programs

**Community Context:**
- 70% speak Yiddish as first language
- Limited secular education
- Cultural privacy concerns
- Single-income households with 6-8 children

**Safeguards:**
- Identity verification required
- Stated purpose and acknowledgment signature required
- Annual caps enforced
- Payment method flexible (check, e-transfer, vendor, gift card)
- Random follow-up calls (10% selection) — no receipts required

### Tier 2: Full Documentation ($5,000+)

**Legal Context:** Per Credit Counselling Services of Atlantic Canada Inc. v. Canada (2016 FCA 193), beneficiaries must be **currently experiencing poverty** at the time assistance is provided. This tier ensures thorough verification for higher-value assistance.

**Payment Frequency:** Annual lump sum payments are acceptable. Ongoing assistance requires annual re-verification, but payment frequency (annual/quarterly/monthly) is at organization's discretion.

**Requirements:**
- Notice of Assessment (both spouses) - confirms current income
- Social Insurance Number
- Date of birth
- Family size verification
- Signed declaration of current financial hardship

**60% Deficit Formula:**
1. Calculate annual family costs (using researched amounts)
2. Subtract verified household income
3. Multiply deficit by 60%
4. This equals maximum annual assistance

**Example:**
- Family of 8 costs: $168,000
- Verified income: $100,000
- Deficit: $68,000
- Maximum assistance: $68,000 × 0.60 = $40,800

## 4.2 Assistance Categories and Limits

### Annual Maximum by Family Size
| Family Size | Annual Maximum |
|-------------|----------------|
| 4 members | $30,000 |
| 6 members | $36,000 |
| 8 members | $42,000 |
| 10 members | $48,000 |

### Category Limits (Monthly)
| Category | Maximum |
|----------|---------|
| Rent | $1,500 |
| Food | $500 |
| Utilities | $400 |
| Medical | $2,000 |
| Education | Varies |

## 4.3 Application Process

### Step 1: Initial Assessment
- Determine assistance amount requested
- Route to appropriate tier

### Step 2: Documentation

**Application Form:** One base form used for all amounts

**Under $5,000:**
- Government ID
- Completed base application form
- Signed declaration: "I need financial assistance for my day-to-day needs"

**$5,000 and Over:**
- All above PLUS these attachments:
  - Notice of Assessment (both spouses)
  - Budget worksheet
  - Full income documentation

### Step 3: Verification
**Under $5,000:**
- Identity confirmation
- Database check for previous assistance
- Community verification if available

**$5,000 and Over:**
- Complete income verification
- Deficit calculation
- Board approval

### Step 4: Disbursement

**Payment Methods (all acceptable with proper documentation):**
- Check to recipient — most common method
- E-transfer to recipient — for urgent needs or recipient preference
- Direct to vendor — when practical and recipient prefers
- Grocery gift cards — for food assistance

**Documentation Required:**
- Stated purpose on application (rent, food, utilities, etc.)
- Recipient acknowledgment signature
- Payment record (check copy or e-transfer confirmation)

**Self-Declaration Model:**
Consistent with food banks and other poverty relief charities, we do not require recipients to provide receipts or proof of spending. The recipient's signed acknowledgment of intended use is sufficient documentation.

### Step 5: Follow-up
- Under $1,000: No follow-up required
- $1,000-5,000: 30-day check-in
- Over $5,000: 30, 60, 90-day assessment

# APPENDIX E: DIRECT PAYMENT POLICY

## Payment Methods and Documentation
### Toirem Canada — December 2025

This policy establishes documentation requirements for all payment methods, balancing CRA compliance with practical community realities.

**Guiding Principle:** Recipients sign a declaration attesting to their need and intended use of funds. This self-declaration model is consistent with food banks and other CRA-registered poverty relief charities.

### Available Payment Methods

| Method | Description | When Used |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Direct to vendor** | Payment to landlord, utility company, etc. | When vendor accepts and recipient prefers |
| **Check to recipient** | Check made payable to recipient | Common method; recipient handles payment |
| **E-transfer to recipient** | Interac e-transfer to recipient | Urgent needs; recipient preference |
| **Gift cards** | Grocery store gift cards | Food assistance |
| **Cash** | Physical cash | Emergency only; requires director approval |

### Documentation Requirements

**For ALL Payments:**
- Application form with stated purpose
- Recipient acknowledgment signature
- Government photo ID
- Payment record (check copy or e-transfer confirmation)

**NO receipts required from recipients. The signed acknowledgment of intended use is sufficient.**

### Follow-Up Process

Follow-up is **not** to verify receipts or audit spending. It's to:
- Check if the assistance resolved the crisis
- Identify if additional help is needed
- Build relationship and trust
- Document outcomes for impact reporting

| Amount | Follow-Up Required? |
|--------|-------------------|
| Under $1,000 | No |
| $1,000 - $2,999 | Optional check-in if time permits |
| $3,000 - $4,999 | Recommended 30-day check-in |
| $5,000+ | Yes - 30-day and 90-day check-in |

### CRA Compliance

This approach meets CRA requirements through:
- Declaration + NOA for larger amounts (beneficiaries in poverty)
- Stated purpose + recipient acknowledgment (charitable purpose)
- Application, payment records, follow-up notes (adequate records)
- ID verification, database tracking, periodic follow-up (due diligence)

**Why We Don't Require Receipts:**
1. CRA doesn't mandate them — No CRA guidance requires receipt collection from beneficiaries
2. Food bank precedent — Self-declaration is standard in poverty relief sector
3. Declaration is sufficient — Recipient attests under signature to intended use
4. Practical barriers — Many recipients cannot easily provide receipts
5. Trust-based model — Consistent with community values and effective service delivery
