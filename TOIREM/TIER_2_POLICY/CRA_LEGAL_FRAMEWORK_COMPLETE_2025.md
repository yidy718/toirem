# PART IV: OPERATIONAL FRAMEWORK

## 4.1 Two-Tier System Rationale

### Tier 1: Declaration-Based (Under $5,000)

**CRA Legal Authority:**
- **CG-032 (December 2023)** explicitly classifies grants up to $5,000 as "low risk"
- CG-032 states: "A written agreement may not be necessary for non-recurring grants of $5,000 or less"
- **CG-029 (October 2024)** permits simplified verification when "the potential of providing non-incidental private benefit is negligible"
- Similar to food bank model (CRA-compliant for decades)
- Statutory declaration equivalent accepted in Canadian social programs

**Community Context:**
- 70% speak Yiddish as first language
- Limited secular education
- Cultural privacy concerns
- Single-income households with 6-8 children

**Safeguards:**
- Identity verification required
- Annual caps enforced
- Direct vendor payment preferred
- Random audits (10% selection)

### Tier 2: Full Documentation ($5,000+)

**Legal Context:** Per Credit Counselling Services of Atlantic Canada Inc. v. Canada (2016 FCA 193), beneficiaries must be **currently experiencing poverty** at the time assistance is provided. This tier ensures thorough verification for higher-value assistance.

**Requirements:**
- Notice of Assessment (both spouses) - confirms current income
- Social Insurance Number
- Date of birth
- Family size verification
- Signed declaration of current financial hardship

**60% Deficit Formula:**
1. Calculate annual family costs (using researched amounts)
2. Subtract verified household income
3. Multiply deficit by 60%
4. This equals maximum annual assistance

**Example:**
- Family of 8 costs: $168,000
- Verified income: $100,000
- Deficit: $68,000
- Maximum assistance: $68,000 × 0.60 = $40,800

## 4.2 Assistance Categories and Limits

### Annual Maximum by Family Size
| Family Size | Annual Maximum |
|-------------|----------------|
| 4 members | $30,000 |
| 6 members | $36,000 |
| 8 members | $42,000 |
| 10 members | $48,000 |

### Category Limits (Monthly)
| Category | Maximum |
|----------|---------|
| Rent | $1,500 |
| Food | $500 |
| Utilities | $400 |
| Medical | $2,000 |
| Education | Varies |
