# THE DECLARATION-BASED ASSISTANCE SYSTEM
## Toirem Canada's Simplified Approach for Amounts Under $5,000

---

## 🖊️ ONE SIGNATURE REPLACES INCOME VERIFICATION

For assistance requests **under $5,000**, Toirem Canada uses a **declaration-based system** where the applicant's signature on a statement of need replaces the requirement for income documentation.

---

## THE DECLARATION

### What Applicants Sign:

> **"I declare that I need financial assistance for my personal day-to-day needs [including food, clothing, rent, tuition, etc.]"**

### What This Signature Means:
- Legal attestation of financial need
- Commitment that information is truthful
- Authorization for assistance
- Agreement to verification if selected

### What It Replaces:
- ❌ Tax returns/Notice of Assessment
- ❌ Pay stubs
- ❌ Bank statements
- ❌ Employment letters
- ❌ Detailed budgets

---

## WHY THIS WORKS

### 1. Cultural Context
In the Hasidic community, one's word and signature carry sacred weight. False declarations would result in severe community consequences beyond any legal penalties.

### 2. Practical Reality
Families with 6-8 children facing eviction don't have time to gather months of documentation. The declaration allows immediate response to urgent needs.

### 3. Observable Verification
Staff can verify need through:
- Family size (visible)
- Housing conditions (observable)
- Community knowledge (rabbinical awareness)
- Request patterns (basic necessities only)

### 4. Natural Limits
- Maximum $5,000 per request
- Category caps (rent $1,500/month, food $500/month)
- Annual family limits
- All payment methods acceptable (check, e-transfer, vendor, gift card)

## THE TWO-TIER STRUCTURE

| Amount | Verification Method | Processing Time | Why |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|-----|
| **Under $5,000** | Signed Declaration | 24-48 hours | Emergency needs, barrier reduction |
| **$5,000 and Over** | Full Income Docs (NOA both spouses) | 5-10 days | Larger amounts need verification |
