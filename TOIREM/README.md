## 🎯 PROJECT OVERVIEW

Toirem Canada (Faire un Don Canada) is a registered Canadian charity providing poverty relief to Montreal's Hasidic Jewish community. This repository contains our complete operational framework organized into a professional 6-tier compliance structure.

### Our Mission
Provide financial assistance to large Orthodox Jewish families facing poverty, recognizing their unique challenges:
- Average 6-8 children per family (vs. 1.6 Canadian average)
- Mandatory kosher food costs (40-80% premium)
- Religious education expenses ($7,000-$10,120 per child)
- Religious obligations ($15,966 annually)
- 68-93% higher living costs than general population

- **Purpose:** Emergency assistance without barriers

### Tier 2: Standard Assistance (Religious cost differential)
- **Threshold:** Exceptional costs due to religious observance
- **Documentation:** Declaration of Need
- **Formula:** 60% of deficit (Costs - Income)
- **Processing:** 5-10 business days
- **Legal Basis:** CG-029 risk-proportionate approach

## 📊 KEY FINDINGS

### Cost Reality for Hasidic Families:

| Family Size | Annual Cost | vs. General Population |
|-------------|-------------|------------------------|
| Family of 4 | $110,496 | +68.5% |
| Family of 6 | $157,674 | +78.4% |
| Family of 8 | $198,074 | +83.7% |
| Family of 10 | $238,766 | +92.6% |

*Source: Statistics Canada, CMHC, community research (Dec 2025)*

### Why Standard Poverty Measures Fail:
- **MBM (Market Basket Measure):** Based on family of 4, not 8-10
- **No religious costs:** Doesn't include kosher food or education
- **Housing assumptions:** Assumes 3BR adequate (need 5-6BR)
- **Income assumptions:** Assumes dual income (often single)
